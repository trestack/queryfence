/**
 * Prints the summary and writes the report when the test plan ends.
 *
 * <p>Registered through {@code META-INF/services}, so it runs for every JUnit Platform launch — the
 * JUnit extension, {@code queryfence-spring-test}, Maven, Gradle and the IDE alike — without any
 * test code.
 *
 * <p>This exists because a JVM shutdown hook is too late: Surefire has closed the channel that
 * relays the forked JVM's output by then, so the summary was written to a stream nobody reads. The
 * end of the test plan is still inside the run, so the summary reaches the build log. The shutdown
 * hook stays as a fallback for runs that are not launched by the platform, and printing is guarded,
 * so the summary appears once.
