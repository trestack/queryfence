# CLAUDE.md — QueryFence

Context for AI coding agents working in this repository. Read fully before making changes.

## What this project is

**QueryFence** — SQL policy testing for the JVM ("ArchUnit for SQL").

Users declare rules once (e.g. every query touching `purchase_order` must filter by `tenant_id`).
During integration tests, QueryFence captures every SQL statement actually sent to the database
(from JPA/Hibernate, MyBatis, jOOQ, JdbcTemplate, native queries, AI-written code), parses it,
checks it against the policy, and fails the build on violations — pointing to the exact
class, method and line that produced the SQL.

Primary problem: multi-tenant data leaks caused by a missing `WHERE tenant_id = ?`.

It **verifies** isolation. It does **not** replace runtime enforcement (Postgres RLS,
Hibernate `@TenantId`/filters, MyBatis-Plus tenant interceptor). It complements them.

## Brand and coordinates

- Umbrella brand: **Trestack** ("tre" = bamboo; tagline: *Backend tools that bend, not break.*)
- GitHub: `github.com/trestack/queryfence`
- Maven groupId: `io.github.trestack` (no domain yet; may relocate to `dev.trestack` later)
- Java packages: `dev.trestack.queryfence.*` — keep these even though groupId differs,
  so a future groupId relocation never breaks user imports

## Modules

| Module | Purpose | Allowed dependencies |
|---|---|---|
| `queryfence-core` | Parser adapter, rule engine, policy model | **JSqlParser only** |
| `queryfence-jdbc` | Capture SQL via datasource-proxy, resolve origin via `StackWalker` | core, datasource-proxy |
| `queryfence-report` | Collects findings per policy, console summary, `report.json` | jdbc |
| `queryfence-junit5` | JUnit 5 extension, YAML policy loading | report, junit-jupiter-api (`provided`), snakeyaml |
| `queryfence-spring-test` | Auto-wrap every `DataSource` bean in Spring test contexts; primary entry point for Spring Boot users | junit5, report, spring-test + spring-context + junit-jupiter-api (`provided`) |
| `queryfence-bom` | Version alignment | — |

| `queryfence-integration-tests` | Testcontainers matrix: {Hibernate, MyBatis, JdbcTemplate} × {MySQL, Postgres}; not published | everything, test scope |

`examples/` holds two standalone Spring Boot projects (MySQL + MyBatis, Postgres + JPA) that run
with `docker compose up`; they are not part of the reactor.

## Architecture rules (do not break)

1. `queryfence-core` must never depend on JDBC, JUnit, Spring or YAML libraries. It also must not
   *model* them: a `Violation` says what is wrong with a statement, never where the statement came
   from. Origins are a capture concern and live in `queryfence-jdbc` (`Origin`, `Finding`), so the
   engine stays reusable outside tests (runtime mode, text-to-SQL validation).
2. **Fail closed.** Anything we cannot prove safe is a violation. Unparseable SQL is a
   violation by default (`onUnparseable: FAIL`), user may downgrade.
3. Suppressions live in the policy (YAML / builder) keyed by `Class#method` and **require a
   reason**. Never add annotations that production code would need to depend on.
4. Public API is small and explicit. Anything not meant for users goes in an `internal`
   package. Prefer interfaces + static factories over exposing implementation classes.
5. Parse results are cached by SQL string.

## Rule semantics: `require-predicate`

`docs/DESIGN.md` is the specification (clauses RP-1..RP-13, UW-*, DW-*); the golden corpus is its
executable form. Summary:

A statement passes when **every occurrence** of a protected table — in FROM, JOIN, subqueries
(WHERE/FROM/SELECT list), CTEs, each UNION branch, UPDATE/DELETE targets (including joined forms),
and INSERT...SELECT sources — is *fenced* by the conditions of its own query block:

- **Value predicate:** `<alias>.<column> = <parameter | literal | allowed function>` or
  `<alias>.<column> IN (<values>)`. Functions are rejected unless listed in the rule's
  `allowedFunctions` (e.g. `current_setting`).
- **Transitive:** `x.tenant_id = y.tenant_id` fences one side when the other is already fenced;
  a chain needs at least one value-predicate anchor. Correlated subqueries may anchor on a fenced
  occurrence of an enclosing block.
- **AND/OR:** an AND fences what any conjunct fences (with propagation); an **OR fences X only if
  every branch fences X**, recursively (`tenant_id = ? OR 1=1` is a bypass).
- **Alias binding:** the predicate must be bound to **that occurrence's alias**. An unqualified
  column only binds in a single-table block; otherwise one `AMBIGUOUS_COLUMN` violation per block.
- **Placement:** WHERE, any INNER JOIN's ON, or the ON of the LEFT JOIN that introduces the table.
  Not: preserved side of an outer join's ON, RIGHT/FULL JOIN ON, HAVING.
- **Derived tables / CTEs:** filters outside do not fence tables inside (no pushdown in v0.1) —
  a known false-positive source, measured in Phase 5.

INSERT: the column must be present in the column list. DDL and TRUNCATE are ignored; MERGE on a
protected table is `UNSUPPORTED_STATEMENT`.
Identifiers compare case-insensitively; handle quoted identifiers (MySQL backticks,
Postgres double quotes) and schema-qualified names (`app.purchase_order`).
Every violation message states the problem **and the fix**, from fixed templates in DESIGN.md.

Capture window: the test method body and everything it calls; `@BeforeEach`/`@AfterEach`,
context startup and migrations are not checked.

Checking parameter *values* against the current tenant is out of scope for v0.1.

## v0.1 scope

In: `require-predicate`, `update-without-where`, `delete-without-where`, JUnit 5 extension,
`queryfence-spring-test` (zero-code setup for Spring Boot: dependency + `queryfence.yml`),
modes FAIL and REPORT, YAML + Java builder policy, suppressions with reason, console report,
`target/queryfence/report.json`, examples on MySQL and Postgres.

Out (do not build yet): runtime blocking, Spring Boot starter for production use, baseline file, HTML report,
parameter value checks, custom rule DSL, UI.

## Testing approach

- **Golden corpus** is the heart of the project: `queryfence-core/src/test/resources/corpus`,
  data files of SQL + expected violations (including the exact message), loaded by
  `GoldenCorpusTest`. Each case declares its `clause` (a DESIGN.md id), `policy` and `dialect`
  (ansi/mysql/postgres). `CorpusStructureTest` checks ids, clauses, dialects and policies.
- Every rule change or bug fix adds corpus cases first (test-first). Prefer a violating case for
  every structure that only has a passing one.
- **Metamorphic test**: `MetamorphicTest` removes each tenant predicate of every passing case from
  the parsed statement (never from the SQL text) and requires a violation. A passing case that
  survives the removal is an engine hole.
- PIT mutation testing on the rule engine, threshold 88%: `./mvnw -pl queryfence-core -Pmutation
  verify` (CI job "Mutation testing (JDK 21)").
- Integration tests via Testcontainers: {Hibernate, MyBatis, JdbcTemplate} × {MySQL, Postgres},
  each with a deliberately leaky query that must be caught **and** a correct query that must not be
  reported. They need Docker and only run with `-Pintegration` (CI job "Integration tests"), so the
  everyday `./mvnw verify` stays fast and Docker-free.
- Application code in those tests lives in `com.acme.*`: QueryFence skips its own packages when it
  resolves an origin, so fixtures in `dev.trestack.*` would resolve to the test framework instead.

## Conventions

- Java 17 baseline; CI runs 17, 21, 25.
- Format: `./mvnw spotless:apply` (google-java-format, license header required).
- Before every commit: `./mvnw verify` must pass.
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `ci:`.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]` for user-visible changes.
- Keep versions in the parent `pom.xml` `<properties>`.
- **Do not upgrade `junit-bom` to 6.x before the platform decision is made** (see
  `docs/decisions/junit-platform.md`). `junit-jupiter-api` is `provided` in the published modules,
  and CI runs them against the oldest and the newest supported JUnit. The JUnit platform QueryFence
  builds on is part of the public contract of `queryfence-junit5`, so that decision belongs to
  Phase 3, where the extension is designed. Close or hold Dependabot PRs that propose it.

### Workflow

- `main` is protected by a ruleset: changes land only through pull requests, and the
  `Build (JDK 17)`, `Build (JDK 21)` and `Build (JDK 25)` checks must pass on a branch that is
  up to date with `main`. Force-push and branch deletion are blocked.
- Never commit or push directly to `main`. Work on a branch named by change type:
  `feat/...`, `fix/...`, `docs/...`, `test/...`, `chore/...`.
- Open a pull request whose description states **what** changed and **why**, plus anything the
  maintainer should review closely (decisions taken, open questions).
- Wait for CI to be green on the PR. **Never merge**, enable auto-merge or approve on the
  maintainer's behalf: the maintainer reads and merges every PR.
- No AI attribution trailers (`Co-Authored-By: Claude`, "Generated with Claude Code") in commits
  or PR descriptions.

## Security — never do these

- Never read, print, create or commit GPG keys, passphrases, Central Portal tokens or any
  secret. Release credentials live only in GitHub Secrets.
- Never run `-Prelease deploy`, push tags, or trigger a release. Releasing is done by the
  maintainer manually.
- Rule-bypass reports are security issues: see `SECURITY.md`.

## Current status and plan

Phase 0 to Phase 2 are done (design, 197 golden cases, rule engine, metamorphic tests, PIT, SQL
capture with origin resolution). Phase 3 (current): `queryfence-junit5` fails tests and writes
reports, `queryfence-spring-test` wraps the `DataSource` beans of a Spring test context.

1. Phase 0 — design on paper (README, DESIGN.md, 30 cases)
2. Phase 1 — core + golden corpus (≥150 cases) + PIT
3. Phase 2 — jdbc capture + origin detection
4. Phase 3 — JUnit 5 extension + Spring test support + reports
5. Phase 4 — Testcontainers matrix + examples
6. Phase 5 — dogfood in real projects in REPORT mode (target <5% false positives)
7. Phase 6 — docs site (MkDocs Material, `trestack.github.io/queryfence`, include `llms.txt`)
8. Phase 7 — release 0.1.0 (tag `v0.1.0`; workflow uploads with autoPublish=false)
9. Phase 8 — launch post and community

Competitive landscape to stay aware of: TenantLayer (Postgres RLS, Hibernate only),
MyBatis-Plus `TenantLineInnerInterceptor`, Hibernate `@TenantId`, Python `sql-guardrail`.
